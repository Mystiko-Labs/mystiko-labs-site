**Perhaps** is a true love finding app.
One of the quintessential features of our app is that **we help bring together the people who feel this mutual affection for each other but are too shy to reveal their true feelings**.


## Idea

* You can register on the app using your google or facebook account. 
* After registering, you can login using the google or facebook account you used in previous step.
* The first thing you see after logging in is the dashboard. There you can see your current counts. And the people that you have liked ( in the crushes list ) and that matches that you have got ( in the matches list ).
* You can search for people using the fab button in the bottom right corner of your dashboard. You can search for a person using their name, hometown or college/work. 
* In the same place, you can also view a random assortment of people available for like.
* You will get a notification everytime someone likes you but that person's identity will not be revealed to you. You will also get a notification in the event of an match and that person is added to your matched list.


## Technology

* Android 
* Node Js
* MLab (NoSQL database)
