## Practizi = Practicals made easy


**Practizi** is a learning management system.  


This web app will help to reduce the paperwork and will make practical/assignment submissions a breeze. 

We have used Materialize.css framework to work on it, with the backend of PHP and Mysqli. 

The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/raavan-n/Practizi-Learning-management-System">Github</a>
